Hi Sam,

Could you please make 2 more of these cables when you get a chance?

One row is AO channels, the other is AI channels.
The white paint marks AO0/AI0 and channels increase sequentially from there.
The side with the latch should be AI pins, the opposite side should be AO pins.

Also, do you have a file? If so, could you file the female side of the connectors so that they all seat adjacent to one another a set of pin headers? Right now, I have trouble plugging two female ends next to each other without the black plastic getting in the way.

Thank you so much! If you have any questions, you can email me at kbuffo@uiowa.edu
